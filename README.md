# E06a-Bullets
This exercise messes with collisions involving projectile bullets hitting penguin sprites. When the mouse button is clicked, a bullet sprite is projected, and if it collides with a penguin sprite, the health counter of the penguin is reduced by a damage amount predetermined in the code. It also increases a score amount indicated for the player. if a penguin's health hits zero, it vanishes.
